# Don't Get a Virus
A video game I'm working on. The point of the game is to not get a virus on your computer. I'm making the game with [Love2D](https://love2d.org/).

The game will act as a computer, and you're supposed to avoid getting viruses on that computer.
You will be given various tasks, and you will have to complete the tasks without getting any viruses.
If you get a virus, the game turns into a frantic bullet-hell type game while you try to save your computer from the virus.
There will be many different types of viruses with different types of mini games.
If you fail a viruses minigame, the virus takes over the computer and you lose the game.

To run my code, you will need to get the love2d framework, available [here](https://love2d.org/)! After installation, execute this code by dragging the game folder onto the LOVE icon. More detailed instructions are available on the [LOVE Wiki.](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started)

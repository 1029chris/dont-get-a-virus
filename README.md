# Don't Get a Virus
An idea for a game. The point of the game is to not get a virus on your computer. I'm making the game with [Love2D](https://love2d.org/).

The game will act as a computer, and you're supposed to avoid getting viruses on the computer.
You will be given various tasks, and you will have to complete the tasks without getting any viruses.
If you get a virus, the game turns into a frantic bullet-hell type game while you try to save your computer from the virus.
There will be many different types of viruses with different types of mini games.
If you fail a viruses minigame, the virus takes over and you loose the game.

The game is in it's very early stages.
